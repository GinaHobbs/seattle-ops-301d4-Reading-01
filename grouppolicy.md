# What is Group Policy and What Role Does it Play in Data Security?

Group Policy is a feature of Windows that allows a network administrator to control the working environment of users and computers in Active Directory. It provides a central place for admins to manage and configure OS's, applications and user settings. 

A Group Policy Object is a group of settings that control the settings on the client computer. Using them you can create different effects such as a user always going to a specific home page on the internet browser.
