# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

There are 7 layers to the OSI model. In this model the networking layer is layer 3. It is reponsible for packet forwarding, including routing through intermediate routers. Layer 2 is the data link layer and is responsible for the transfer of data between nodes on a network segment across the physical layer. 

Wireshark is a tool that allows us to capture network packets and see what's in them. It is used by many entities that need a safe tool for sniffing network packets and troublehsooting the network. Anything colored black indicates an issue, which makes it easy to troubleshoot using wireshark.
