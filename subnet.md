# What is Network Segmentation and CIDR Block Notation

A CIDR block is a range of IP addresses and CIDR notation is a way to express it. An example of CIDR notation would be 10.0.0.0/16. The "/" indicates how many bits make up the subnet mask.

Network segmentation is used to divide a network into smaller pieces, also known as subnets. This is done to prevent widespread attacks and to isolate users to specific subnets that have resouorces on it that only those users need. These subnets are a useful way to add more protection to the network, especially since firewalls can become outdated. Creating these subnets is like creating a hedge maze that attackers have to traverse, and it  an tehrefore lead to them leaving your network to find an easier target to exploit.
